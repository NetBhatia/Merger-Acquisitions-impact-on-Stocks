# Title: Movieâ€™s budget vs OMDB rating
This EDA project examines the relationship between movie revenue and ratings, specifically focusing on how a movie's ratings, both user and critic ratings, might impact its box office revenue. The project uses data obtained from the OMDB API to analyze various aspects of movies, including ratings, revenue, and genres.

# Key Questions:
The analysis seeks to answer the following key questions:
Is a movie's revenue dependent on the ratings it earns?
Is the count of votes a key factor towards a movie's ratings?
Are there some genres that earn higher revenue despite receiving lesser votes or ratings?
Is there a correlation between a movie's ratings and revenue and count of votes and revenue?

# Data Analysis
In the MovieBudgetResearch.ipynb notebook, we perform the following steps:
Data Retrieval: At first we found the OMDB API to obtain movie data, including titles, ratings, votes, and box office revenue. But afterwards, we found a OMDB library that we could use to make it easier to retrieve data.
Data Cleaning: We clean and preprocess the data to remove any missing values and convert columns to appropriate data types.
Data Visualization: We create various visualizations to explore the relationships between ratings, revenue, and other factors.
Statistical Analysis: We use statistical tests and techniques to assess correlations and make inferences.

# Usage:
The data can be used in Entertainment industry to analyse if ratings and vote count play an important role towards a movie's success.
